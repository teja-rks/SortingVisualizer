# Sorting Visualizer

## 📌 Project Overview
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application built using **React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that helps users understand various sorting algorithms through **real-time animations**. Instead of using traditional bars, this visualizer displays **actual numbers moving dynamically** while sorting, providing a more intuitive learning experience.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Unique Number Display** – The sorting process is visualized using numbers instead of bars.
- ✅ **Multiple Sorting Algorithms** – Supports:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- ✅ **Random Array Generator** – Generates a new set of **unique random numbers** each time.
- ✅ **Smooth Animations** – Shows how numbers move while sorting, with direct transitions.
- ✅ **Fixed Unique Colors** – Each number has a unique color that remains the same throughout the sorting process.
- ✅ **Step Counter** – Displays the number of passes taken to sort the array.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Controls** – Choose a sorting algorithm, generate a new array, and start sorting with a click.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
